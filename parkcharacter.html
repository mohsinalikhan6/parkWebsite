                    Mickey Mouse is a cartoon character created in 1928 by Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks at The Walt Disney Studios, who serves as
                    the mascot of the Walt Disney Company. An anthropomorphic mouse who typically wears red shorts, large
                    yellow shoes, and white gloves, Mickey is one of the world's most recognizable fictional characters.
                    Created as a replacement for a prior Disney character, Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, Mickey first appeared
                    in the short Plane Crazy, debuting publicly in the short film Steamboat Willie (1928), one of the first
                    sound cartoons. He went on to appear in over 130 films, including The Band Concert (1935), Brave Little
                    Tailor (1938), and Fantasia (1940). Mickey appeared primarily in short films, but also occasionally in
                    feature-length films. Ten of Mickey's cartoons were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated
                    Short Film, one of which, Lend a Paw, won the award in 1942. In 1978, Mickey became the first cartoon
                    character to have a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Beginning in 1930, Mickey has also been featured
                    extensively in comic strips and comic books. The Mickey Mouse comic strip, drawn primarily by Floyd Gottfredson,
                    ran for 45 years. Mickey has also appeared in comic books such as Mickey Mouse, Disney Italy's Topolino
                    and MM – Mickey Mouse Mystery Magazine, and Wizards of Mickey. Mickey also features in television series
                    such as The Mickey Mouse Club (1955–1996) and others. He appears in other media such as video games as
                    well as merchandising, and is a meetable character at the Disney parks.
